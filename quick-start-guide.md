Bobby Johnson forked the project and renamed it Louie after his dog. AlooAkbar forked Louie and added the necessary modifications for the simple and free deployment of the bot using Heroku. ZyC0R3 Picked up the fork and as part of a team fixed over 200 errors and brought it into the modern age, All would like to thank Aziz for his hard work and making these early versions OSS so that others may learn and build on his hard work to share with the community.
